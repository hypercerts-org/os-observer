{# 
  Onchain address segementation using the RFM model.
  
  RFM stands for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value.
  In this version, we adapt the M to represent the 
  number of projects a user has interacted with.
  
  We will consider the following metrics:
  - Recency: Days since last activity
  - Frequency: Total activity
  - Monetary Value: Project count
  
  We will then assign a segment to each user based on these
  metrics.
