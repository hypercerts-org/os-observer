Start here to learn about different ways of integrating OSO data into your workflow.

Create an account and get started with the OSO API.

## Create an account

---

First, navigate to [www.opensource.observer](https://www.opensource.observer) and create a new account.
If you already have an account, log in.

## Create a new personal API key

---

1. Go to [Account settings](https://www.opensource.observer/app/settings)
2. In the "Personal API Keys" section, click "+ Create a Personal API Key"
3. Give your key a label - this is just for you, usually to describe a key's purpose.
4. At the top of your list, you should see your brand new key. **Immediately** copy its value, as you'll **never** see it again after refreshing the page.

You can create as many keys as you like.
