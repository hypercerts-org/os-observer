Currently, we offer factories for two types of APIs: REST and GraphQL. These
factories allow you to ingest data from APIs with minimal effort. Here are the
guides to help you get started:

- [REST API Crawler](./rest-api.md): This guide will walk you through the
  process of creating a REST API crawler using our `rest` factory. It will show
  you how to define the endpoints you want to fetch, create a configuration
  object, and build the asset.
- [GraphQL API Crawler](./graphql-api.md): This guide will explain how to use
  the GraphQL Resource Factory to bootstrap a `graphql_factory` asset in Dagster
  that fetches all fields from a GraphQL endpoint automatically.
