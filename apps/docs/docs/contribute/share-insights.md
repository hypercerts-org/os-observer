:::info
OSO is building a network of impact data scientists and curating a community library of Jupyter notebooks, blog posts, data visualizations, and promising "impact vectors". Whether you're a data scientist, a writer, or a visual artist, your contributions can help enrich the world's understanding and appreciation of open source impact.

## Community Data Science

Share your work analyzing and visualizing OSS data by contributing to the [Insights repo](https://github.com/opensource-observer/insights). In general, the steps are:

1. Fork the [Insights repo](https://github.com/opensource-observer/insights/fork).
2. Add your contribution to the appropriate destination directory (see below).
3. Submit a pull request from your fork back to [Insights](https://github.com/opensource-observer/insights).

### Notebooks

We've included some starter notebooks to help data scientists get going with OSO datasets. You can find templates and community notebooks [here](https://github.com/opensource-observer/insights/blob/main/community/notebooks).

Also check out our playbook for [doing data science](../integrate/data-science) with OSO data.

If you've created a notebook that you think our community can learn from, submit a PR to the `./community/notebooks/` directory in the Insights repo. Please include markdown in your notebook to explain your work.

### Visualizations

Most of our visualizations are generated in Python using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. You can find our library of visualization templates [here](https://github.com/opensource-observer/insights/blob/main/visualizations/).

Contribute your own data visualization templates by adding them to the `./visualizations/` directory in the Insights repo. Please include a docstring in your visualization script explaining the expected data format and a brief description of use cases.

### Impact Metrcs

We're building scripts and analysis frameworks for community-generated impact metrics. Submissions must be replicable with data sourced entirely from the OSO data warehouse and should follow the follow the [Impact Metrics Specification](../how-oso-works/impact-metrics/).

In most cases, impact vectors will be reviewed and recognized via one of our Data Challenges, with separate instructions for showcasing work and submitting pull requests.

### Blog Posts

If you are interested in writing or co-authoring a data-driven blog post, please [open an issue](https://github.com/opensource-observer/insights/issues) in the Insights repo with your proposal. Include a brief outline of your topic and why it's relevant to our audience.

Our best blog posts typically focus on specific communities and use a mix of storytelling and data visualization.

## Best Practices

- Ensure your contributions are original, well-documented, and provide clear value to the OSO community.
- For Jupyter notebooks and data visualizations, include source data or instructions on how to replicate the scripts.
- Review existing contributions to avoid duplicating efforts and to build upon existing work.
- Be open to feedback and collaboration from the OSO community during the review process of your pull request.

## Promoting Your Work

Once your contribution is accepted and merged, it will be featured in our library and may be highlighted in our community channels and outreach efforts.

We also encourage you to share your work via your own channels and on social media. Please remember to note that your analysis is "Powered by OSO" in the introduction or in specific sections of the piece.

We're excited to see the diverse and impactful ways our community explores and represents open source data!
