:::info
An **event** is a record of a transaction or other activity involving an artifact, or a snapshot of cumulative events at a given point in time. Events are used to track the history of an artifact.

## Overview

---

Every event is associated with an artifact that belongs to a single project. For example, a GitHub commit event is an event `from` a GitHub user artifact `to` a GitHub repo artifact owned by a single project. Similarly, a blockchain transaction event would be an event `from` a blockchain address artifact `to` another blockchain address artifact owned by a single project.

The `to` and `from` relationships between artifacts in an event are critical to OSO's ability to understand the impact of a project's activities and situate it in the context of overall network / ecosystem activity.
