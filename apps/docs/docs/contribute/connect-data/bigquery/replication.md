BigQuery comes with a built-in data transfer service
for replicating datasets between BigQuery projects/regions,
from Amazon S3, and from various Google services.
In this guide, we'll copy an existing BigQuery dataset into the
`opensource-observer` Google Cloud project at a regular schedule.

If you already maintain a public dataset in
the US multi-region, you should simply make a dbt source
as shown in [this guide](./index.md).
