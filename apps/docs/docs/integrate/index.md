Open Source Observer is a fully open data pipeline for measuring the impact of open source efforts.
That means all source code, data, and infrastructure is publicly available for use.

- [Fork the data pipeline](./fork-pipeline): to setup your own data pipeline off any OSO model
- [Connect OSO to 3rd Party tools](./3rd-party): like Hex.tech, Tableau, and Metabase
- [API access](./api): to integrate OSO metrics into a live production application
