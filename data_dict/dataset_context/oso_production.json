    "description": "The OSO Production Data Pipeline is a daily-updated pipeline that consists of queryable and downloadable stages of data. The pipeline is built using dbt-based models and is split into staging, intermediate, and mart models. The final mart models serve data from an API, providing project-level information such as OSS directory projects and code metrics. Staging and intermediate models include a universal event table containing event data (e.g., git commits, contract invocations) which are aggregated into metrics for downstream use.",
    "use_cases": [
      "Retrieving OSS directory project lists",
      "Querying code metrics by project",
      "Aggregating event metrics such as daily contract invocations",
      "Analyzing data at different stages of the pipeline (staging, intermediate, mart models)"
