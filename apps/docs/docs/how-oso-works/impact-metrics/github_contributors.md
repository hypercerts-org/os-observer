# GitHub Contributors

:::info
OSO maintains categories for developers and other types of contributors, and assigns activity levels to them based on their contributions. GitHub metrics are typically queried by project (eg, `uniswap`), although they can also be queried by repo in the format (eg, `repo-owner/repo-name`). For information about GitHub data, also see: [Github Activity](./github_activity).

## Contributors

---

Contributors are GitHub users who contribute commits, issues (opened/closed), and pull requests (opened/merged) to one or more of a project's code repositories.

### contributors

The total number of contributors across all the project's repositories.

### contributors_6_months

The number of contributors who have contributed to the project's repositories in the last 6 months.

### new_contributors_6_months

The number of new contributors to the project's repositories in the last 6 months.

## Developers

---

A developer is a contributor who commits code to the main branch of one or more of a project's repositories. Our definitions for full-time and part-time developers are intended to align with the methodology used by Electric Capital in their [Developer Report](https://www.developerreport.com/about).

### avg_fulltime_devs_6_months

The average number of full-time developers working on the project's repositories in the last 6 months. A full-time developer is defined as a contributor who has made commits to main on at least 10 days in a given month.

### avg_active_devs_6_months

The average number of active developers contributing to the project's repositories in the last 6 months, including both full-time and part-time developers. An active developer is defined as a contributor who has made commits to main on at least 1 day in a given month.
