There are a variety of ways you can contribute to OSO.

### Update Project Data

We are always expanding our directory of OSS projects. Add a new project or update project information by submitting a PR to the [OSS Directory](https://github.com/opensource-observer/oss-directory).

### Add Funding Data

We are also building a database of funding information for open source projects. Add a new funding source or complete missing fields by submitting a PR to the [OSS Funding repo](https://github.com/opensource-observer/oss-funding).

### Connect Your Data

OSO becomes more useful the more public data we are able to connect to OSS projects. Write a plugin or work with us in other ways to bring your data source into the OSO data warehouse.

### Propose an Impact Model

Our data warehouse relies on dbt for turning raw data into **models** that quantify different OSS impact metrics. Write new models in SQL and propose the best ones for us to include in our GraphQL API by submitting a PR to the [OSO Monorepo](https://github.com/opensource-observer/oso).

### Share Insights

OSO wants to be the hub for impact data science for open source ecosystems. Contribute to our library of data visualizations and Jupyter notebooks by submitting a PR to the [Insights repo](https://github.com/opensource-observer/insights).
