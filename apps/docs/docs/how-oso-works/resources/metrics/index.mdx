:::info
An **impact metric** is a quantitative measure of impact over a discrete period of time. Impact metrics are most commonly queried by project (eg, `uniswap`), although they can also be queried by individual artifact or at the collection level.
:::

## Requirements

---

An impact metric must be:

- A quantitative measure of impact on a continuous scale. Common examples include counts, sums, averages, and medians.
- Available for all projects in the OSO database (even if many projects have a null value). Metrics should be extendable to any collection in the OSO database as well as any artifact in the same artifact namespace (eg, GitHub-related metrics, npm-related metrics, etc.).
- Aggregated over a discrete period of time. Common time intervals include last 90 days, last 180 days, and since inception. OSO has already bucketed event data in daily, weekly, and monthly intervals to facilitate this.
- Constructed from data that is available in one or more [mart models](https://github.com/opensource-observer/oso/tree/main/dbt/models/marts). Common mart models include `projects`, `events_monthly_to_project`, and `first_contribution_to_project`.

## Sample Metrics

---

### Forks in the Last 6 Months (Project Level)

The following is an example of a valid impact metric, expressed in SQL:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="query" label="Query" default>
    ```sql
      -- Sum of fork events to a project in the last 6 months
      SELECT
        project_id,
        SUM(amount) AS forks_6_months
      FROM `oso.events_monthly_to_project`
      WHERE 
        event_type = 'FORKED'
        AND DATE(bucket_month) >= DATE_ADD(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL -6 MONTH)
      GROUP BY project_id
      ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="response" label="Response">
    ```json
      [{
        "project_id": "jUda1pi-FdNlaUmgKq51B4h8x4wX3QTN2fZkKq6N0vw\u003d",
        "forks_6_months": "125.0"
      }, {
        "project_id": "wdBmT3yweChtV4g4qcc1NN1QtfnmMPAuCVxoPkiAowY\u003d",
        "forks_6_months": "57.0"
      }, {
        "project_id": "HNv9-2g63oZCrLD2jDAIygVq7vQkn2iV2QGmEfcFsYk\u003d",
        "forks_6_months": "13.0"
      }]
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Forks in the Last 6 Months (Artifact Level)

Here is the same metric calculated at the **artifact** level:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="query" label="Query" default>
    ```sql
      -- Sum of fork events to an artifact in the last 6 months
      SELECT
        artifact_id,
        SUM(amount) AS forks_6_months
      FROM `oso.events_monthly_to_artifact`
      WHERE 
        event_type = 'FORKED'
        AND DATE(bucket_month) >= DATE_ADD(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL -6 MONTH)
      GROUP BY artifact_id
      ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="response" label="Response">
    ```json
      [{
        "artifact_id": "vg-apoPrbCtAM4enk0Ar4tODrqTBi9ZDnNnTw-udjw4\u003d",
        "forks_6_months": "1.0"
      }, {
        "artifact_id": "7ZqXfQTqiCHHcRw-THEsTgz8W1T0apGyLe7rE8n0NCs\u003d",
        "forks_6_months": "5.0"
      }, {
        "artifact_id": "PM9tS7Fp_-LmYT8B-dx8FFBz7xa8rEwm9RFAZ6JehcI\u003d",
        "forks_6_months": "1.0"
      }]
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Days from First Commit to First Onchain Transaction

Here's a more complex impact metric that uses a CTE to calculate the number of days from the first commit to a project to its first onchain transaction. Note that this query returns null for projects that have not yet had an onchain transaction. It also returns a negative value for projects where the first onchain transaction occurred before the first commit to a public repo.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="query" label="Query" default>
    ```sql
      -- Number of days from the first commit to a project to its first onchain transaction
      WITH first_events AS (
        SELECT
          project_id,
          MIN(CASE WHEN event_type = 'COMMIT_CODE' THEN bucket_day END) AS first_commit,
          MIN(CASE WHEN event_type = 'CONTRACT_INVOCATION_DAILY_COUNT' THEN bucket_day END) AS first_txn
        FROM `oso.events_daily_to_project`
        GROUP BY project_id
      )
      SELECT
        project_id,
        DATE_DIFF(first_txn, first_commit, DAY) AS days_from_first_commit_to_first_txn
      FROM first_events
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="response" label="Response">
    ```json
      [{
        "project_id": "-A5N7DYgI4bDZZQaF_4SPw_qx6cv1BbfcoxJ7rZxig8\u003d",
        "days_from_first_commit_to_first_txn": "554"
      }, {
        "project_id": "-KeRKHB_H0HcNkR2_SLUC1vLy46YWoaZSMrjpiW3d5s\u003d",
        "days_from_first_commit_to_first_txn": null
      }, {
        "project_id": "-ceY1smj0ZhYH-JSMeK3opMBmLgc29Oe-m5cOd-KnjY\u003d",
        "days_from_first_commit_to_first_txn": "412"
      }, {
        "project_id": "-cqm4kiQPXiAI9GserwK_Jf2AF05Ygc5Mcmf6S9igjk\u003d",
        "days_from_first_commit_to_first_txn": null
      }, {
        "project_id": "03kU3p5lLpFpNokCY76xugHThITxzXmzVae__BGZKFc\u003d",
        "days_from_first_commit_to_first_txn": "-47"
      }]
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Issues Closed to Full-Time Contributors in the Last 90 Days

Finally, here's an example of a metric that utilizes one of the `users` mart models to calculate the ratio of issues closed to full-time contributors to a project in the last 90 days:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="query" label="Query" default>
    ```sql
      -- Ratio of issues closed to full-time contributors to a project in the last 90 days
      WITH full_time_contributors AS (
        SELECT
          project_id,
          SUM(amount) AS full_time_contributors
        FROM `oso.users_monthly_to_project`
        WHERE
          user_segment_type = 'FULL_TIME_DEV'
          AND DATE(bucket_month) >= DATE_ADD(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL -90 DAY)
        GROUP BY project_id
      )
      , issues_closed AS (
        SELECT
          project_id,
          SUM(amount) AS issues_closed
        FROM `oso.events_monthly_to_project`
        WHERE
          event_type = 'ISSUE_CLOSED'
          AND DATE(bucket_month) >= DATE_ADD(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL -90 DAY)
        GROUP BY project_id
      )
      SELECT
        ftc.project_id,
        ic.issues_closed / ftc.full_time_contributors AS issues_closed_to_full_time_contributors_90_days
      FROM full_time_contributors ftc
      LEFT JOIN issues_closed ic ON ftc.project_id = ic.project_id
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="response" label="Response">
    ```json
      [{
        "project_id": "--IMjbfK8bKS7MWr-7g9HHKcKRI6BMVb6FX0oIP2QXc\u003d",
        "issues_closed_to_full_time_contributors_90_days": "12.6"
      }, {
        "project_id": "-A5N7DYgI4bDZZQaF_4SPw_qx6cv1BbfcoxJ7rZxig8\u003d",
        "issues_closed_to_full_time_contributors_90_days": "0.6"
      }, {
        "project_id": "-GaxcdxeEp_4kF03wAjs-aHrRoiGwl0BrK0cYYEU0o0\u003d",
        "issues_closed_to_full_time_contributors_90_days": null
      }, {
        "project_id": "-Ne1fzPhJNWO4DD07pTXuFqfLwl3A_Zyq397l5W73s4\u003d",
        "issues_closed_to_full_time_contributors_90_days": "3.0"
      }, {
        "project_id": "-XW3PLKpOAQWReyRlL30Ho_aYRYzHm3kVAG_5JAEtOQ\u003d",
        "issues_closed_to_full_time_contributors_90_days": "1.0"
      }]
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
