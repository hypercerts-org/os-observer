# Tips for Making Bulk Updates to OSS Directory

To make bulk updates, we recommend cloning the [OSS Directory](https://github.com/opensource-observer/oss-directory) repo and making changes locally. Then, submit a complete set of project updates via one PR.

Given that the project data may come in all sorts of formats, we have not included a script that will work for all cases. We have included a [few scripts](https://github.com/opensource-observer/oss-directory/tree/main/src/scripts) as examples. These take CSV or JSON files that contain a list of projects and associated artifacts.

If you need help making a bulk update, please [open an issue](https://github.com/opensource-observer/oss-directory/issues) and tag one of the maintainers.
