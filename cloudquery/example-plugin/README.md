# Example CloudQuery Plugin

Copy this to start a new plugin and add it to the repository root's
pyproject.toml

The folder structure was originally derived from [CloudQuery's Typeform
Plugin](https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery/tree/main/plugins/source/typeform),
but it was edited to fit the folder structure we expect for the oso repository.
