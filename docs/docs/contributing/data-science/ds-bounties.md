Occassionally we post data bounties and run community competitions. Each bounty has a set of requirements and a reward. Generally, the first person to meet the requirements will receive the reward although in some cases there may be multiple prizes or an award for runner-ups.

Some of our past bounties can be found [here](https://github.com/opensource-observer/insights/tree/main/experiments).

The best way to learn about new data bounties is to follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/OSObserver) or join our [Discord](https://www.opensource.observer/discord).

You can also see a list of any active bounties from our GitHub issues [here](https://github.com/opensource-observer/insights/issues).
