# Developers

> This document outlines how we define and categorize developers, and how we assign activity levels to them based on their contributions.

A **developer** is a GitHub user who contributes to a repository or organization through various activities. These activities include:

- **Commit**: An individual change to a file (or set of files).
- **Open Pull Request**: Proposed changes to a repository submitted by a user.
- **Merged Pull Request**: A pull request accepted and merged by a repository's collaborator.
- **Submitted Issue**: Suggestions, tasks, or questions related to the repository.
- **Closed Issue**: An issue resolved and closed by a repository's collaborator.
- **Code Review**: A systematic examination of a pull request performed by a collaborator.

A developer is considered **active** if they've made at least one contribution in the past 30 days.

A developer is considered **new** if they made their first contribution in the past 90 days.

## Types of Developers

OS Observer identifies three main types of developers: collaborators, contributors, and maintainers.

### Collaborators

Collaborators are GitHub users granted read and write access to a repository by its owner. 

To qualify as an **active** collaborator, one must have made at least one contribution (of any type) within the past 30 days.

### Contributors

Contributors are GitHub users who, although lacking collaborator access, have had a pull request they opened merged into the repository's main branch.

An **active** contributor is defined as someone who has opened at least one pull request in the past 30 days.

### Maintainers

Maintainers are trusted collaborators given additional responsibilities, such as conducting code reviews, merging pull requests, and closing issues.

To be considered an **active** maintainer, one must have engaged in at least one of the aforementioned activities in the past 30 days.
