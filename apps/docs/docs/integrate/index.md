Open Source Observer is a fully open data pipeline for measuring the impact of open source efforts.
That means all source code, data, and infrastructure is publicly available for use.

- [**Data Overview**](./overview/index.mdx): for an overview of all data available
- [**BigQuery Studio Guide**](./query-data.mdx): to quickly query and download any data
- [**Python notebooks**](./python-notebooks.md): to do more in-depth data science and processing
- [**Fork the data pipeline**](./fork-pipeline.md): to setup your own data pipeline off any OSO model
- [**Connect OSO to 3rd Party tools**](./3rd-party.mdx): like Hex.tech, Tableau, and Metabase
- [**API access**](./api.md): to integrate OSO metrics into a live production application
- [**oss-directory**](./oss-directory.md): to leverage [oss-directory](https://github.com/opensource-observer/oss-directory) data separate from OSO
