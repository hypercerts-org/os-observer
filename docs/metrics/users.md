# Onchain Users

> This document outlines how we define and categorize blockchain users, and how we assign activity levels to them based on their onchain activity.

A **user** is a unique blockchain address that interacts with a smart contract and pays a gas fee back to the underlying network. 

Users may either be:
- Externally owned accounts (EOAs), ie, accounts managed by a private key
- Smart contract accounts (SCAs), ie, accounts controlled by a multisig or utilized account abstraction (ERC-4337)

Further categorization of users is based on their activity levels on a given network. For more information, see [Onchain Metrics](./onchain.md).
