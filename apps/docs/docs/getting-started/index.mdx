:::info
The [Kariba Data Collective](https://kariba.network) is our effort to build a network of impact data scientists. We are looking for ongoing contributors to add/update information about open source projects, to explore the data and generate useful insights, and to connect new data sources and build better tools on top of OSO.
:::


If you think you'll be an ongoing contributor to OSO, or want access to the OSO data warehouse, then your first step is to join the [Data Collective](https://kariba.network). Membership is free but we want to keep the community close-knit and mission-aligned. 

 As the community grows, we want to reward the most useful contributions and in so doing create a new job category for impact data science.
