:::info
There are two easy ways of accessing OSO datasets: through our GraphQL API
and through our data warehouse on BigQuery. 
For live integrations, you'll want [API access](../integrate/api.md).
For exploratory analysis and impact data science,
it's best to go direct to the data warehouse. 
:::

OSO's data warehouse is currently located in BigQuery on Google Cloud (GCP).
Every data model is made publicly available by a BigQuery dataset.

See our [data exchange](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery/analytics-hub/exchanges/projects/87806073973/locations/us/dataExchanges/open_source_observer_190181416ae)
on Google Analytics Hub for a full list of public data sets. 

## Sign up for Google Cloud

Navigate to [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) and log in.
If this is your first time here, you can sign up for a free cloud account
using your existing Google account.
If you already have a GCP account,
[skip to the query](#make-your-first-query).

![GCP Signup](./gcp_signup.png)

First, select a country and agree to the terms of service.
Then, you need to enter your payment information for verification
and answer a few marketing questions.

:::tip
GCP offers a free tier that includes $300 in credits. After that, it is easy to stay in the free tier provided you remain under the
1TB per month limit for BigQuery data processed (more on that later).
:::

Finally, you will be brought to the admin console where you can create a new project.
Feel free to name this GCP project anything you'd like.
(Or you can simply leave the default project name 'My First Project'.)

## Make your first query

Go to the [BigQuery Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery).
Navigate to **BigQuery** from the left-hand menu and
then click on **BigQuery Studio** from the hover menu.

![GCP Admin](./gcp_admin.png)

The console features an **Explorer** frame on the left-hand side,
which lists all the datasets available to you,
and a **Studio Console** which has tabs for organizing your work.
This will be your workspace for querying the OSO dataset.

![GCP Welcome](./gcp_welcome.png)

Open a new tab by clicking on the `+` icon
on the top right of the console to `Create SQL Query`.

From here you will be able to write any SQL you'd like any OSO dataset.
For example, you can query the `oso_playground` dataset for 
a sample of collections like this:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM `opensource-observer.oso_playground.collections_v1`
```

Click **Run** to execute your query.
The results will appear in a table at the bottom of the console.

![GCP Query](./gcp_query.png)

The console will help you complete your query as you type, and will also provide you with a preview of the results and computation time. You can save your queries, download the results, and even make simple visualizations directly from the console.

:::tip
To explore all the OSO datasets available, see [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery/analytics-hub/exchanges/projects/87806073973/locations/us/dataExchanges/open_source_observer_190181416ae).

- **oso** contains all production data. This can be quite large depending on the dataset.
- **oso\_playground** contains only the last 2 weeks for every dataset. We recommend using this for development and testing.

## Next steps

Now that you're set up, there are many ways to contribute to OSO and integrate the data with your application:

- [Do Data Science](../integrate/data-science) over OSO data sets
- [Propose an impact model](../contribute/impact-models) to run in our data pipeline
- [Query the OSO API](../integrate/api) for metrics and impact vectors from your web app

If you think you'll be an ongoing contributor to OSO,
please apply to join the [Kariba Data Collective](https://www.kariba.network). 

Membership is free but we want to keep the community close-knit and mission-aligned.
As the community grows, we want to reward the most useful contributions and
in so doing create a [new job category for impact data science](https://docs.opensource.observer/blog/impact-data-scientists).
