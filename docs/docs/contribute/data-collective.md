We are looking for contributors to add/update information about open source projects, to explore the data and generate useful insights, and to connect new data sources and build better tools on top of OSO.

Membership is free but we want to keep the community close-knit and mission-aligned.

If this interests you, please apply to join our [Data Collective](https://www.kariba.network/).
