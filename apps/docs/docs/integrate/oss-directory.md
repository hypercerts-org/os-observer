:::info
[oss-directory](https://github.com/opensource-observer/oss-directory) contains structured data on as many open source projects as possible, enumerating all artifacts related to the project, from source code repositories to published packages and deployments. You can get the data via our npm library or downloading the data directly from GitHub.
:::

## Directory Structure

---

The OSS Directory is organized into two main folders:

- `./data/projects` - each file represents a single open source project and contains all of the artifacts for that project.
  - See `./src/resources/schema/project.json` for the expected JSON schema
  - Files should be named by the project `name`
  - A project's `name` must be globally unique. If there is a conflict in chosen `name`, we will give priority to the project that has the associated GitHub organization
  - In most cases, we adopt the GitHub organization name as the `name`. If the project is not associated with a GitHub organization, you try to use the project name followed by the repo owner as the `name`.
- `./data/collections` - each file represents a collection of projects that have some collective meaning (e.g. all projects in an ecosystem).
  - See `./src/resources/schema/collection.json` for the expected JSON schema
  - Collections are identified by their unique `name`

## npm library

---

[oss-directory](https://www.npmjs.com/package/oss-directory)
is a library that you can use in your own projects.
This may be useful if you want to build a tool that uses the data
in this repository or perform your own custom analysis.

### Installation

Install the library

```bash
npm install --save oss-directory
# OR yarn add oss-directory
# OR pnpm add oss-directory
```

### Fetch all of the data

You can fetch all of the data in this repo with the following:

```js
import { Project, Collection, fetchData } from "oss-directory";

const data = await fetchData();
const projects: Project[] = data.projects;
const collections: Collection[] = data.collections;
```

:::note
We don't store the entire dataset with the npm package. Under the hood, this will clone the repository into a temporary directory, read all the data files, validate the schema, and return the objects. This way, you know you're getting the latest data, even if the npm package hasn't been updated in a while.
If we make a breaking change in a
[schema update](../how-oso-works/oss-directory/schema-updates.md)
you will need to update this library or an exception will throw
due to a typing mismatch with the old library version.

## Direct Download from GitHub

---

All of the data is accessible from directly GitHub. You can download
[oss-directory](https://github.com/opensource-observer/oss-directory)
directly from GitHub.

Or, clone the repository from the command line:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/opensource-observer/oss-directory.git
```

Feel free to use the data in your own projects!
