Over the past few months, we've been hard at work creating the infrastructure to collect and analyze impact metrics for open source projects. We're excited to announce that we're ready to start doing some new analysis on data from open source projects ... and we need your help!

This post includes some of the domains we're interested in exploring as well as an initial list of impact metrics we'd like to collect. We're looking for feedback on these metrics and suggestions for additional metrics we should consider. We're also looking for contributors to help us apply these impact metrics.

## Get Involved

If you'd like to get involved, here's what to do:

1. Apply to [join the Data Collective](https://www.kariba.network/). It only takes a few minutes. We'll review, and reach out to schedule an onboarding call.
2. Join our [Discord server](https://www.opensource.observer/discord) and say hello.
3. Get inspiration from our Colab directory of [starter notebooks for impact metrics](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1I4exiLfZYgPwIGBEzuAMeGtJUhtS_DE7?usp=drive_link).
4. Consult [our docs](https://docs.opensource.observer/docs/) and especially our [impact metric spec](https://docs.opensource.observer/docs/how-oso-works/impact-metrics/) as you prepare your analysis.

The rest of this post includes more details on the types of impact metrics we're interested in.

## Areas of Interest

At a high level, we're interested in the following types of impact metrics being applied to the OSO dataset:

- **Project Health**: Metrics that capture the momentum and activity of a project's contributor community and codebase.
- **Project Licensing**: Metrics that capture the licensing and open sourciness of a project.
- **Onchain Reputation**: Metrics that attempt to differentiate onchain users based on behavior and trust scores.
- **Contributor Reputation**: Metrics that attempt to differentiate code contributors based on behavior and PageRank-style scoring.
- **Ecosystem Impact**: Metrics that capture the impact of a project on the broader health of an open source ecosystem, ie, as a "talent feeder" or "dependency" for other projects.
- **Domain-specific Onchain Impact**: Metrics that are relevant only to a specific domain, such as "defi" or "consumer", for onchain projects.

## Working List of Impact Metrics

Here's a working list of impact metrics we're interested in collecting, including links or ideas for how to calculate them. We've flagged a few that are good first issues for contributors to work on.

### Ecosystem Impact

Metrics that capture the impact of a project on the broader health of an open source ecosystem, ie, as a "talent feeder" or "dependency" for other projects.

| Impact Metric         | Description                                                                                 | Inspiration | Comments         |

### Domain-specific Onchain Impact

Metrics that are relevant only to a specific domain, such as "defi" or "consumer", for onchain projects.

The first step in this process is to define a domain and create a list of projects that are relevant to that domain. We're currently working on this process and will be sharing more details soon. Then, any of the above metrics (as well as our existing onchain impact metrics) can be applied to the projects in that domain.

This is a good first issue for people with domain expertise who are able to curate a list of projects relevant to a specific domain.
