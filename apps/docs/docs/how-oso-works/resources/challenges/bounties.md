:::info
The aim of our bounty program is to encourage and reward the community for contributing to the growth and experimentation on OSO. Bounties are only available to members of the [Kariba Data Collective](https://kariba.network).

## Competitive Bounties

Occassionally we post data science bounties and run community competitions. Each bounty has a set of requirements and a reward. Generally, the first person to meet the requirements will receive the reward although in some cases there may be multiple prizes or an award for runner-ups.

Some of our past data science bounties can be found on [Bountycaster](https://www.bountycaster.xyz/fid/19412).

The best way to learn about new data bounties is to follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/OSObserver) or join our [Discord](https://www.opensource.observer/discord). You can also see a list of any active bounties from our GitHub issues [here](https://github.com/opensource-observer/insights/issues).

## Ongoing Bounties

We also have a number of ongoing bounties for contributing to the OSS Directory. These bounties are available to all members of the Data Collective and are paid out in USDC.

:::note
Please reach out to one of the maintainers for guidance on what projects and ecosystems we're currently looking for help with. We don't want to waste your time on projects that are already well-covered or that we don't have the capacity to review.
