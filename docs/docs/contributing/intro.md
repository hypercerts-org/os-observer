OSO is looking for contributions to add/update information about open source projects, to explore the data and generate useful insights, and to connect new data sources and build better tools on top of OSO.

## Project Information

It might not be the sexiest form of contribution, but it's the most important. We need to make sure that the data we have is accurate and up to date. This is a great way to get started with OSO.

Anyone can add a new project or update project information by submitting a PR to the [OSS Directory](https://github.com/opensource-observer/oss-directory).

For more information on how to contribute to the OSS Directory, check out the [Add/Update Project Information](./contributing/add-update/intro) section.

## Analysis and Data Science

We are building the place to do impact data science for open source ecosystems. We know how hard it is to get clean data ready to analyze in a Jupyter Notebook or whatever you platform you prefer for doing exploratory data analysis and visualizations. We want to remove those barriers and grow a decentralized data science community that believes in open source, open data, and open infrastructure.

Our [insights repo](https://github.com/opensource-observer/insights) is the place to share your analysis and visualizations.

For more information on how to contribute meaningful open source insights, check out the [Analysis and Data Science](./contributing/data-science/intro) section.

## Data Engineering

You have ideas for new data sources and want to help us connect them? You see a world of possible integrations and want to help other developers build on top of OSO? You believe in truly open infra and want to help us break down the cost barriers and complexity of running a data pipeline?

Our [OSO mono repo](https://github.com/opensource-observer/oso) is the place for data engineers who want to contribute to our core mission.
