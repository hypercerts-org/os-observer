Open Source Observer is a fully open data pipeline for measuring the impact of open source efforts.
That means all source code, data, and infrastructure is publicly available for use.

- [**Subscribe to Public Datasets**](./datasets/index.mdx): for an overview of all data available
- [**Explore the OSO Data Lake**](./query-data.mdx): all OSO data is available in BigQuery for you to explore and connect to your own tools
- [**Use the GraphQL API**](./api.md): integrate OSO registries and metrics into a live production application
- [**Import or clone oss-directory**](./oss-directory.md): leverage [oss-directory](https://github.com/opensource-observer/oss-directory) data separate from OSO

See the [Tutorials](../tutorials/index.md) for more examples and the [Guides](../guides/index.mdx) for more detailed guides for integrating with specific tools (eg, Jupyter, Hex, etc).
