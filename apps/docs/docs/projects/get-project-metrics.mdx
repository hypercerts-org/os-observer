:::tip
Once you're project is indexed, you can get metrics about your project using our GraphQL API or directly from BigQuery. It's always safer to query on the `project_id` field rather than the `name` or `display_name` fields.
:::

## Find Your `project_id`

You can lookup your project's `project_id` using either BigQuery or our GraphQL API:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="sql" label="SQL">

```sql
select
  project_id,
  project_name,
  display_name,
  description
from `oso_production.projects_v1`
where project_name = 'opensource-observer'
```

In the case of `opensource-observer`, we get back the following:

```json 
{
  "project_id": "Erx9J64anc8oSeN-wDKm0sojJf8ONrFVYbQ7GFnqSyc=",
  "project_name": "opensource-observer",
  "display_name": "Open Source Observer",
  "description": "Open Source Observer is a free analytics suite that helps funders measure the impact of open source software contributions to the health of their ecosystem."
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="graphql" label="GraphQL">

```graphql
query findProject {
  oso_projectsV1(
    where: { projectName: { _eq: "opensource-observer" } }
  ) {
    projectId
    projectName
    displayName
    description
  }
}
```

In the case of `opensource-observer`, we get back the following:

```json 
{
  "projectId": "Erx9J64anc8oSeN-wDKm0sojJf8ONrFVYbQ7GFnqSyc=",
  "projectName": "opensource-observer",
  "displayName": "Open Source Observer",
  "description": "Open Source Observer is a free analytics suite that helps funders measure the impact of open source software contributions to the health of their ecosystem."
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Get Code Metrics

OSO maintains a standard set of basic code metrics for each project.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="sql" label="SQL">

```sql
select *
from `oso_production.code_metrics_by_project_v1`
where project_id = 'Erx9J64anc8oSeN-wDKm0sojJf8ONrFVYbQ7GFnqSyc='
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="graphql" label="GraphQL">

```graphql
query getCodeMetrics {
  oso_codeMetricsByProjectV1(
    where: { projectId: { _eq: "Erx9J64anc8oSeN-wDKm0sojJf8ONrFVYbQ7GFnqSyc=" } }
  ) {
    repositoryCount,
    forkCount,
    starCount,
    activeDeveloperCount6Months,
    contributorCount6Months,
    ...
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Get Onchain Metrics

OSO maintains a standard set of onchain metrics for each project, available by network. If you want metrics for a specific network, you can use the `event_source` field in your query, eg, `event_source = 'BASE'`.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="sql" label="SQL">

```sql
select *
from `oso_production.onchain_metrics_by_project_v1`
where project_id = 'XyKL4912vsx41aNjTJDLDexSgi4_BcPkilZ8twJlqxI=' -- Aave
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="graphql" label="GraphQL">

```graphql
query getOnchainMetrics {
  oso_onchainMetricsByProjectV1(
    where: { projectId: { _eq: "XyKL4912vsx41aNjTJDLDexSgi4_BcPkilZ8twJlqxI=" } }
  ) {
    eventSource,
    transactionCount,
    gasFeesSum,
    addressCount90Days,
    newAddressCount90Days,
    ...
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Get Funding Data

You can also explore funding data for your project (currently only available on BigQuery for a limited set of grants programs).

For example:

```sql
select
  from_project_name,
  sum(amount) as funding_amount
from `oso_production.oss_funding_v0`
where to_project_id = 'Erx9J64anc8oSeN-wDKm0sojJf8ONrFVYbQ7GFnqSyc='
group by 1
```

## Timeseries Metrics

OSO also maintains a standard set of timeseries metrics for each project (currently only available on BigQuery for a limited timerange).

For example:

```sql
select
  sample_date,
  metric_name,
  amount,
  unit
from `oso_production.timeseries_metrics_by_project_v0` tm
join `oso_production.metrics_v0` m on tm.metric_id = m.metric_id
where tm.project_id = 'Erx9J64anc8oSeN-wDKm0sojJf8ONrFVYbQ7GFnqSyc='
```
