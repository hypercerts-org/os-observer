[Open Source Observer](https://www.opensource.observer)
is a community effort for measuring the impact of open source software.
Our data and models evolve with the community in a way that is
[open source, open data, open infrastructure](../../blog/open-source-open-data-open-infra).

There are two easy ways of accessing OSO datasets:
through our GraphQL API
and through our public data lake on BigQuery.

- For live integrations in a production application, you'll want [API access](./api.mdx).
- For exploratory analysis and data science, go direct to the [data lake](./bigquery.mdx).

If you think you'll be an ongoing contributor to OSO,
please apply to join the [Kariba Data Collective](https://www.kariba.network).
