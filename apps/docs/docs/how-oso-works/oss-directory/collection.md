:::info
A **collection** is a group of related open source projects in the OSS Directory. Projects may belong to multiple collections. For example, a collection may include all projects that are part of a particular ecosystem or all projects that are dependent on a given developer library.

## Names

---

The `name` field is used to identify the collection. It is a unique identifier that is used to reference the collection in other parts of the directory. It should be a string that is all lowercase and contains only letters, numbers, and hyphens.

You can browse examples of collections in the [OSS Directory](https://github.com/opensource-observer/oss-directory/tree/main/data/collections).

## Display Name and Description

---

The `display_name` is a required field used to store a working name for the collection. It is case sensitive. Longer names (eg, greater than 25 chars) may sometimes be truncated in the UI or charts.

The `description` is an optional field used to store a short description of the collection. It is case sensitive. Longer descriptions (eg, greater than 100 chars) may sometimes be truncated in the UI.

## Projects

---

The `projects` field is a required field used to store an array of project names associated with the collection. Each item in the array must be a valid project `name`. If one or more project names are not valid, the collection will not be added to the directory.

You can learn more about adding and updating projects to the OSS Directory [here](./project).
