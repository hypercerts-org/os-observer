There are a number of ways to access OSO data:

- If you want to download a snapshot of the data, the easiest way is to download it directly from BigQuery. Check out our guide to [Get Started](../get-started).
- If you are trying to connect the latest OSO metrics into a live production application, then check out our [GraphQL API](./api).
- If you want to do data science over any dataset, check out this [guide](./data-science).
- If you want to just download the project info from OSS directory, we have [libraries and exports](./oss-directory) that you can use.
