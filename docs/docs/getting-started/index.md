We are looking for contributors to add/update information about open source projects, to explore the data and generate useful insights, and to connect new data sources and build better tools on top of OSO.

If you are interested in joining the Data Collective, your first step is to apply [here](https://www.opensource.observer/data-collective). Membership is free but we want to keep the community close-knit and mission-aligned.
