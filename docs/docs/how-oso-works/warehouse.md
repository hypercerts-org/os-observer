A major dependency of the system is BigQuery. BigQuery is the main storage of the public data warehouse that OSO enables. All of the collected data or aggregated views used by OSO is also made publicly available here (if it is not already a public dataset on BigQuery). External integrators can opt to use this data as they wish.

- Go over warehouse data model
- Indexing pipelines
- Go over obtaining coverage and completeness stats
- Other SLAs

## Contributing

The data warehouse is shared infrastucture maintained by members of the Data Collective.
