:::info
Impact metrics are most commonly queried by project (eg, `uniswap`), although they can also be queried by individual artifact or at the collection level.
:::

The following categories of OSS impact metrics are available:

- [GitHub Activity](./github_activity), including commits, pull requests, issues, and stars for all repositories owned by the project.
- [GitHub Contributors](./github_contributors), including the profile and activity of different types of contributors to the project.
- [Onchain Activity](./onchain_activity), including transaction counts and fees for all smart contracts deployed by the project across supported chains.
- [Onchain Users](./onchain_users), including the number and segmentation of unique addresses that have interacted with the project's smart contracts over different period of time.
- [Node Package Manager (npm) Activity](./npm_activity), including downloads for all packages released by the project.
- [Dependencies](./dependencies), including the number of dependencies and dependents for all packages released by the project.
