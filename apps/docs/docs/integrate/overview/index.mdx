First, you need to set up your BigQuery account. You can do this by going to the
[Get Started](../../get-started/index.mdx)
page.

## OSO Data Exchange on Analytics Hub

To explore all the OSO datasets available,
check out our
[BigQuery data exchange](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery/analytics-hub/exchanges/projects/87806073973/locations/us/dataExchanges/open_source_observer_190181416ae).

Every stage of the OSO data pipeline is queryable and downloadable.
Like most dbt-based pipelines, we split the pipeline stages into
[staging, intermediate, and mart models](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/1-guide-overview).

You can find the reference documentation on every data model on  
[https://models.opensource.observer/](https://models.opensource.observer/)

### OSO Mart Models

These are the final product from the data pipeline,
which is served from our [API](../api.md).

For example, you can get a list of
[oss-directory projects](https://models.opensource.observer/#!/model/model.opensource_observer.projects_v1)

```sql
select
  project_id,
  project_name,
  display_name,
  description
from `YOUR_PROJECT_NAME.oso_production.projects_v1` LIMIT 10
```

or [code metrics by project](https://models.opensource.observer/#!/model/model.opensource_observer.code_metrics_by_project_v1).

```sql
select *
from `YOUR_PROJECT_NAME.oso_production.code_metrics_by_project_v1`
where project_name = 'uniswap'
```

**Remember to replace 'YOUR_PROJECT_NAME' with the name of your project in the query.**

_Note: Unless the model name is versioned, expect that the model is unstable and should not be depended on
in a live production application._

### OSO Staging / Intermediate Models

From source data, we produce a "universal event table", currently stored at
[`int_events`](https://models.opensource.observer/#!/model/model.opensource_observer.int_events).
Each event consists of an [event_type](../../how-oso-works/event.md)
(e.g. a git commit or contract invocation),
[to/from artifacts](../../how-oso-works/oss-directory/artifact.md),
a timestamp, and an amount.

From this event table, we aggregate events in downstream models to produce our metrics.
For example, you may find it cheaper to run queries against
[`int_events_daily_to_project`](https://models.opensource.observer/#!/model/model.opensource_observer.int_events_daily_to_project).

```sql
SELECT event_source, SUM(amount)
FROM `YOUR_PROJECT_NAME.oso_production.int_events_daily_to_project`
WHERE project_id = 'XSDgPwFuQVcj57ARcKTGrm2w80KKlqJxaBWF6jZqe7w=' AND event_type = 'CONTRACT_INVOCATION_DAILY_COUNT'
GROUP BY project_id, event_source
```

GitHub data is predominantly provided by the incredible
[GH Archive](https://www.gharchive.org/) project, which publishes a public
archive of historical events to GitHub.

For example, to count the number of issues opened, closed, and reopened on 2020/01/01:

```sql
SELECT event as issue_status, COUNT(*) as cnt FROM (
  SELECT type, repo.name, actor.login,
    JSON_EXTRACT(payload, '$.action') as event,
  FROM `githubarchive.day.20200101`
  WHERE type = 'IssuesEvent'
)
GROUP by issue_status;

The Google Cloud team maintains a public
[Ethereum dataset](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/ethereum-bigquery-public-dataset-smart-contract-analytics).
This is backed by the [ethereum-etl](https://github.com/blockchain-etl/ethereum-etl) project.

For example, to get 10 transactions from the latest block

```sql
select
  `hash`,
  block_number,
  from_address,
  to_address,
  value,
  gas,
  gas_price
from `bigquery-public-data.crypto_ethereum.transactions` as transactions

  traces.transaction_hash,   
  txs.from_address as originating_address, 
  txs.to_address as originating_contract,
  traces.from_address as factory_address, 
  traces.to_address as contract_address
from `YOUR_PROJECT_NAME.superchain.base_traces` as traces
inner join transactions as txs
  on txs.hash = traces.transaction_hash
where
  LOWER(traces.from_address) != "0x3fab184622dc19b6109349b94811493bf2a45362"
  and LOWER(trace_type) in ("create", "create2")

/>{" "}

- [Reference documentation](https://models.opensource.observer/#!/source_list/gitcoin)
- [Updated daily](https://dagster.opensource.observer/assets/gitcoin)

[Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/) is the hub of grantmaking in the Ethereum ecosystem. All project, round, and donation data from [regendata.xyz](https://regendata.xyz) is available in this dataset and updated daily.

For example, you can get the total amount of donations mapped to projects in OSO:

```sql
with project_mapping as (
  select distinct
    gitcoin_lookup.project_id as gitcoin_id,
    oso_projects.project_name as oso_name,
    oso_projects.display_name as display_name
  from `opensource-observer`.`gitcoin`.`project_groups_summary` as gitcoin_groups
  left join `opensource-observer`.`gitcoin`.`project_lookup` as gitcoin_lookup
    on gitcoin_groups.group_id = gitcoin_lookup.group_id
  join `opensource-observer`.`oso`.`int_artifacts_in_ossd_by_project` as oso_artifacts
    on gitcoin_groups.latest_project_github = oso_artifacts.artifact_namespace
  join `opensource-observer`.`oso`.`projects_v1` as oso_projects
    on oso_artifacts.project_id = oso_projects.project_id
)
select
  donations.timestamp,
  donations.donor_address,
  project_mapping.oso_name,
  project_mapping.display_name,
  donations.amount_in_usd  
from `opensource-observer`.`gitcoin`.`all_donations` as donations
join project_mapping
  on donations.project_id = project_mapping.gitcoin_id
```  

[Passport](https://passport.xyz/)
is a web3 identity verification protocol.
OSO and Gitcoin have collaborated to make this dataset
of address scores available for use in understanding user reputations.

For example, you can can **vitalik.eth's** passport score:

```sql
select
  passport_address,
  last_score_timestamp,
  evidence_rawScore,
  evidence_threshold,
from YOUR_PROJECT_NAME.gitcoin.passport_scores
where passport_address = '0xd8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045'
```

- [Reference documentation](https://models.opensource.observer/#!/source_list/karma3)
- [Updated daily](https://dagster.opensource.observer/assets/karma3)

[OpenRank](https://openrank.com/) is a reputation protocol that enables
verifiable compute for a large class of reputation algorithms,
in particular those that (a) operate on a graph,
(b) are iterative in nature and (c) have a tendency toward convergence.
Such algorithms include EigenTrust, Collaborative Filtering, Hubs and Authorities,
Latent Semantic Analysis, etc.

In this dataset, Farcaster users reputations are scored in 2 ways:
- With `globaltrust`, we calculate global reputation scores, seeded by the trust of Optimism badgeholders.
- With `localtrust`, you can get reputation scores of other users relative to specified user.

For example, you can get the globaltrust reputation score of **vitalik.eth**

```sql
select
  strategy_id,
  i,
  v,
  date
from YOUR_PROJECT_NAME.karma3.globaltrust
where i = 5650
```

**Remember to replace 'YOUR_PROJECT_NAME' with the name of your project in the query.**

## Subscribe to a dataset

### 1. Data exchange listings

For datasets listed on the OSO public data exchange,
click on the "Subscribe on BigQuery" button to create a new
dataset that is linked to OSO.

![subscribe](./bigquery_subscribe.png)

This has a few benefits:

- Data is automatically kept live and real-time with OSO
- You keep a reference to the data in your own GCP project
- This gives OSO the ability to track public usage of models

### 2. Direct access to datasets

For datasets without a listing on the OSO public data exchange,
we make the dataset open to public queries for direct queries.
Click on the "View on BigQuery" button to go straight
to the dataset.

You can star the dataset to keep it in your project.

![star](./bigquery_starred_datasets.png)

## Next steps

Once you've subscribed our datasets to your own Google project,
you can start to run queries and analyses with a variety of tools.

Here are a few to start:

- [**SQL Query Guide**](../query-data.mdx): to quickly query and download any data
- [**Python notebooks**](../python-notebooks.md): to do more in-depth data science and processing
- [**Connect OSO to 3rd Party tools**](../3rd-party.mdx): like Hex.tech, Tableau, and Metabase
