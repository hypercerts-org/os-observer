Define and track impact vectors for collections of OSS projects.

An impact vector must meet the requirements in the [Impact Vector Specification](./impact-vector-spec).

Would love to see people create their own impact vectors and distribution analyses!

## Creating Impact Vectors

Fork [this notebook](https://github.com/opensource-observer/insights/blob/main/community/datasets/retropgf3_results/ImpactVectors%20vs%20DistributionResults.ipynb) and submit a PR with your impact vector.
