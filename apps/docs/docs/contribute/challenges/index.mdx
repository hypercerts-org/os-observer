We are partnering with several ecosystems to expand project coverage, create new impact metrics and vectors, and improve the quality of our data. We are looking for contributors to help us with these challenges. If you are interested in contributing, please apply to join the [Kariba Data Collective](https://kariba.network).

We currently have one active challenge:

- [Earn OP rewards for proposing onchain impact metrics](./2024-04-05_data_challenge_01/)

We also have [ongoing bounties](./bounties) for adding/updating projects and artifacts.
