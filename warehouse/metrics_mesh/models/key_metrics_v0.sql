-- another approach: get all metrics from oso_metrics (metrics_factories)
-- filter out those we do not care about
-- transform each to the structure we want (id, amount, metric, ..) (sql cte?, macro?)
-- plug into this model
-- generate `metrics.key_metrics_v0_by_{type}` Ã  la timeseries
-- with `metrics_start` and `metrics_end` as `start epoch` and `end` as `@now()`
-- create three models like timeseries does to expose the three types
