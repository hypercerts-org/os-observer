We use a no-code frontend to create dashboards on top of the OSO API.

[Plasmic](https://www.plasmic.app/) is an open source visual editing and content platform for building websites and apps. Each graph on the Open Source Observer website is a React component that can be modified and formatted using Plasmic.
