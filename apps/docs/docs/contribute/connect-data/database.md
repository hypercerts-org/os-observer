import NextSteps from "./dagster-config.mdx"

OSO's dagster infrastructure has support for database replication into our data
warehouse by using Dagster's "embedded-elt" that integrates with the library
[dlt](https://dlthub.com/).

## Configure your database as a dagster asset

There are many possible ways to configure a database as a dagster asset,
however, to reduce complexity of configuration we provide a single interface for
specifying a SQL database for replication. The SQL database _must_ be a database
that is [supported by
dlt](https://dlthub.com/devel/dlt-ecosystem/verified-sources/sql_database). In
general, we replicate _all_ columns and for now custom column selection is not
available in our interface.

This section shows how to setup a database with two tables as a set of sql
assets. The table named `some_incremental_database` has a chronologically
organized or updated dataset and can therefore be loaded incrementally. The
second table, `some_nonincremental_database`, does not have a way to be loaded
incrementally and will force a full refresh upon every sync.

To setup this database replication, you can add a new python file to
`warehouse/oso_dagster/assets`. This file will have the following contents:

```python
from oso_dagster.factories.sql import sql_assets
from oso_dagster.utils.secrets import SecretReference
from dlt.sources import incremental

my_database = sql_assets(
    "my_database", # The asset prefix for this asset. This is the top level name of the asset.
                # You can think of this as the folder for the asset in the dagster UI

    SecretReference(
        group_name="my_group",     # In most cases this should match the asset prefix
        key="db_connection_string" # A name you'd like to use for the secret.
    ),
    [
        {
            "table": "some_time_series_database",
            "incremental": incremental("time")
        },
        {
            "table": "some_non_time_series_database",
        },
    ],
)
```

The first three lines of the file import some necessary tooling to configure a
sql database:

- The first import, `sql_assets`, is an asset factory created by the OSO team
  that enables this "easy" configuration of sql assets.
- The second import, `SecretReference`, is a tool used to reference a secret in
  a secret resolver. The secret resolver can be configured differently based on
  the environment, but on production we use this to reference a cloud based secret
  manager.
- The final import, `incremental`, is used to specify a column to use for
  incremental loading. This is a `dlt` constructor that is passed to the
  configuration.

The `sql_assets`, factory takes 3 arguments:

- The first argument is an asset key prefix which is used to both specify an
  asset key prefix and also used when generating asset related names inside the
  factory. In general, this should match the filename of the containing python
  file unless you have a more complex set of assets to configure. This name is
  also used as the dataset name into which this data will be loaded.
- The second argument must be a `SecretReference` object that will be used to
  retrieve the credentials that you will provide at a later step to the OSO
  team. The `SecretReference` object has two required keyword arguments:

  - `group_name` - Generally this should be the same as the asset key prefix.
    This is an organizational key for the secret manager to use when locating
    the secrets.
  - `key` - This is an arbitrary name for the secret.

- The third argument is a list of dictionaries that define options for tables
  that should be replicated into the data warehouse. The most important options
  here are:

  - `table` - The table name
  - `destination_table_name` - The table name to use in the data warehouse
  - `incremental` - An `incremental` object that defines time/date based column
    to use for incrementally loading a database.

  Other options exist but full documentation is out of scope for this guide. For
  more information, see the `sql_table` function inside the python package
  located at `warehouse/oso_dagster/dlt_sources/sql_database` of the repository.

## Enabling access to your database

Before the OSO infrastructure can begin to synchronize your database to the data
warehouse, it will need to be provided access to the database. At this time
there is no automated process for this. Once you're ready to get your database
integrated, you will want to contact the OSO team on our
[Discord](https://www.opensource.observer/discord). Be prepared to provide
credentials (we will work out a secure method of transmission) and also ensure
that you have access to update any firewall settings that may be required for us
to access your database server.
