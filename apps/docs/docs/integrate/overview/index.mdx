page to setup your BigQuery account.

## OSO Data Exchange on Analytics Hub

To explore all the OSO datasets available on our BigQuery data exchange,
see [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery/analytics-hub/exchanges/projects/87806073973/locations/us/dataExchanges/open_source_observer_190181416ae).

## OSO Production Data Pipeline

Every stage of the OSO data pipeline is queryable and downloadable.
Like most dbt-based pipelines, we split the pipeline stages into
[staging, intermediate, and mart models](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/1-guide-overview).

You can find the reference documentation on every data model on  
[https://models.opensource.observer/](https://models.opensource.observer/)

Data produced by the OSO data pipeline is released under the
[CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)
license.

### OSO Mart Models

These are the final product from the data pipeline,
which is served from our [API](../api.md).

For example, you can get a list of
[oss-directory projects](https://models.opensource.observer/#!/model/model.opensource_observer.projects_v1)

```sql
select
  project_id,
  project_name,
  display_name,
  description
from `YOUR_PROJECT_NAME.oso_production.projects_v1` LIMIT 10
```

or [code metrics by project](https://models.opensource.observer/#!/model/model.opensource_observer.code_metrics_by_project_v1).

```sql
select *
from `YOUR_PROJECT_NAME.oso_production.code_metrics_by_project_v1`
where project_name = 'uniswap'
```

**Remember to update the project name in the query.**

*Note: Unless the model name is versioned, expect that the model is unstable and should not depended on
in a live production application.*


### OSO Staging / Intermediate Models

From source data, we produce a "universal event table", currently stored at
[`int_events`](https://models.opensource.observer/#!/model/model.opensource_observer.int_events).
Each event consists of an [event_type](../../how-oso-works/event.md)
(e.g. a git commit or contract invocation),
[to/from artifacts](../../how-oso-works/oss-directory/artifact.md),
a timestamp, and an amount.

From this event table, we aggregate events in downstream models to produce our metrics.
For example, you may find it cheaper to run queries against
[`int_events_daily_to_project`](https://models.opensource.observer/#!/model/model.opensource_observer.int_events_daily_to_project).

```sql
SELECT event_source, SUM(amount)
FROM `YOUR_PROJECT_NAME.oso_production.int_events_daily_to_project` 
WHERE project_id = 'XSDgPwFuQVcj57ARcKTGrm2w80KKlqJxaBWF6jZqe7w=' AND event_type = 'CONTRACT_INVOCATION_DAILY_COUNT'
GROUP BY project_id, event_source
```

### OSO Playground

We maintain a subset of projects and events in a playground dataset for testing and development.
All of the production models are mirrored in this environment.

## Source Data

### GitHub Data

<Button
  size={"compact"}
  color={"blue"}
  target={"_blank"}
  link={"https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?project=githubarchive&page=project"}
  children={"View on BigQuery"}
/>  

[Reference documentation](https://models.opensource.observer/#!/source_list/github_archive)

GitHub data is predominantly provided by the incredible
[GH Archive](https://www.gharchive.org/) project, which
maintains a BigQuery public dataset that is refreshed every hour.

For example, to count the number of issues opened, closed, and reopened on 2020/01/01:

```sql
SELECT event as issue_status, COUNT(*) as cnt FROM (
  SELECT type, repo.name, actor.login,
    JSON_EXTRACT(payload, '$.action') as event, 
  FROM `githubarchive.day.20200101`
  WHERE type = 'IssuesEvent'
)
GROUP by issue_status;
```

The underlying GitHub data is governed by the GitHub
[terms of service](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service).
GH Archive code and documentation are covered by the
[MIT license](https://github.com/igrigorik/gharchive.org/blob/master/LICENSE.md).

### Ethereum Data

  children={"View on BigQuery"}

[Reference documentation](https://models.opensource.observer/#!/source_list/ethereum)

The Google Cloud team maintains a public
[Ethereum dataset](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/ethereum-bigquery-public-dataset-smart-contract-analytics).
This is backed by the [ethereum-etl](https://github.com/blockchain-etl/ethereum-etl) project.

For example, to get 10 transactions from the latest block

```sql
select
  `hash`,
  block_number,
  from_address,
  to_address,
  value,
  gas,
  gas_price
from `bigquery-public-data.crypto_ethereum.transactions` as transactions
order by block_number desc
limit 10
```

ethereum-etl code is covered by the
[MIT license](https://github.com/blockchain-etl/ethereum-etl/blob/develop/LICENSE).

### Superchain Data

  children={"Subscribe on BigQuery"}
/>  

OSO is proud to provide public datasets for the Superchain,
backed by our partners at
[Goldsky](https://goldsky.com/).

We currently have coverage for:
- [Optimism mainnet](https://models.opensource.observer/#!/source_list/superchain)
- [Base](https://models.opensource.observer/#!/source_list/base)
- [Frax](https://models.opensource.observer/#!/source_list/frax)
- [Metal](https://models.opensource.observer/#!/source_list/metal)
- [Mode](https://models.opensource.observer/#!/source_list/mode)
- [PGN](https://models.opensource.observer/#!/source_list/pgn)
- [Zora](https://models.opensource.observer/#!/source_list/zora)

For terms of use, please see the OSO
[terms and conditions](https://www.opensource.observer/terms).

### Farcaster Data

### Gitcoin Passport Data

<img src={GitcoinLogo} width="200"/>

[Reference documentation](https://models.opensource.observer/#!/source_list/gitcoin)

[Gitcoin Passport](https://passport.gitcoin.co/)
is a web3 identity verification protocol.
OSO and Gitcoin have collaborated to make this dataset
of address scores available for use in understanding user reputations.

For example, you can can vitalik.eth's passport score:

```sql
select
  passport_address,
  last_score_timestamp,
  evidence_rawScore,
  evidence_threshold,
from opensource-observer.gitcoin.passport_scores
where passport_address = '0xd8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045'
```

### OpenRank Data

<img src={OpenrankLogo} width="200"/>

[Reference documentation](https://models.opensource.observer/#!/source_list/karma3)

[OpenRank](https://openrank.com/) is a decentralized reputation protocol based on
[Eigentrust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EigenTrust).
In this dataset, we scored Farcaster IDs.

For example, you can get the reputational score of vitalik.eth

```sql
select
  strategy_id,
  i,
  v,
  date
from opensource-observer.karma3.globaltrust
where i = 5650
```

## Subscribe to a dataset

### 1. Data exchange listings

For datasets listed on the OSO public data exchange,
click on the "Subscribe on BigQuery" button to create a new
dataset that is linked to OSO.

![subscribe](./bigquery_subscribe.png)

This has a few benefits:

- Data is automatically kept live and real-time with OSO
- You keep a reference to the data in your own GCP project
- This gives OSO the ability to track public usage of models

### 2. Direct access to datasets

For datasets without a listing on the OSO public data exchange,
we make the dataset open to public queries for direct queries.
Click on the "View on BigQuery" button to go straight
to the dataset.

You can star the dataset to keep it in your project.
