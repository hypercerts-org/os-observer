Octant recently kicked off **Epoch 3**, its latest reward allocation round, featuring [30 projects](https://octant.app/projects). This round comes three months after Epoch 2, which had a total of 24 projects in it. There are 19 projects continuing on from Epoch 2 into Epoch 3 - including [Open Source Observer](https://octant.app/project/3/0x87fEEd6162CB7dFe6B62F64366742349bF4D1B05).

During the last round, we published ["A snapshot of the 20+ open source software projects in Octant's Epoch 2"](https://docs.opensource.observer/blog/octant-epoch-02-ecosystem-analysis). In this post, we'll refresh that analysis and provide some new insights for the open source software (OSS) projects present in the current cohort.

In Epoch 3, Octant is helping support:

- 26 (out of 30) projects with at least some recent OSS component to their work
- 343 GitHub repos with regular activity
- 651 developers making regular code commits or reviews

In the last 6 months, these 26 projects:

- Attracted 881 first-time contributors
- Closed over 4,646 issues (and created 4,856 new ones)
- Merged over 9,745 pull requests (and opened 11,534 new ones)

## New OSS projects

Epoch 3 has a new cohort of popular, well-established OSS projects. [web3.js](https://octant.app/project/3/0x4C6fd545fc18C6538eC304Ae549717CA58f0D6eb) is one of the leading developer libraries for crypto apps. It has a massive contributor community and more than [80,000 other repos](https://packages.ecosyste.ms/registries/npmjs.org/packages/web3) import its npm package. We also have [web3.py](https://octant.app/project/3/0x5597cD8d55D2Db56b10FF4F8fe69C8922BF6C537), a library for Python developers, one that I personally use frequently (thank you!), and a dependency for [4,000 other repos](https://packages.ecosyste.ms/registries/pypi.org/packages/web3).

The [Ethereum Attestation Service](https://octant.app/project/3/0xBCA48834b3653ec795411EB0FCBE4038F8527d62) is another OSS project conceived of many years ago but reinvigorated more recently. It has a lean team but a fast-growing contributor community and presence across various EVM chains. [Gardens (fka 1Hive)](https://octant.app/project/3/0x809C9f8dd8CA93A41c3adca4972Fa234C28F7714) is another long-standing project with a large footprint of OSS code (more than 100 repos!). It's recent activity has been focused on releasing a Gardens v2. [MetaGov](https://octant.app/project/3/0x9be7267002CAD0b8501f7322d50612CB13788Bcf) is a community laboratory that conducts peer-reviewed research and develops technical standards for emerging technology. It's been steadily building since 2019.

The three younger OSS projects that are new to Epoch 3 are all in the sweet spot for Octant's support: small teams, shipping fast. [growthepie](https://octant.app/project/3/0x9438b8B447179740cD97869997a2FCc9b4AA63a2) is a newer data platform as a public good. Check out their real-time charts including [this one](https://www.growthepie.xyz/fundamentals/profit) showing L2 onchain profits. It's quickly become a go-to source of market information for data nerds (like me), and they are expanding their impact via a new project called the [Open Labels Initiative](https://github.com/openlabelsinitiative). [NiceNode](https://octant.app/project/3/0x9cce47E9cF12C6147c9844adBB81fE85880c4df4) is a simple, open source, desktop app that does exactly what it sounds like: runs a nice node for you. The project has been around for at least 2 years, but its contributor community has doubled over the past 6 months. [StateOfEth (by Ether Alpha)](https://octant.app/project/3/0x0194325BF525Be0D4fBB0856894cEd74Da3B8356) monitors potential attack vectors on Ethereum, including centralization risks, and does outreach to rally the community when needed. The maintainer, Ether Alpha, hosts a bunch of projects on its GitHub and has had a flurry of activity (over 10K commits) in the last 6 months.

## Non-OSS projects

[Funding the Commons](https://octant.app/project/3/0x576edCed7475D8F64a5e2D5227c93Ca57d7f5d20/) is a returning project that acts as a generator function for all sorts of OSS projects and collaboration among projects. For instance, in April, FtC hosted a conference in Berkeley, California all about funding open source software - with representation from a number of the projects in Epoch 3 (Tor, growthepie, Drips, Hypercerts, Gitcoin, MetaGov, Open Source Observer...)

[Boring Security](https://octant.app/project/3/0x52C45Bab6d0827F44a973899666D9Cd18Fd90bCF) is another project supporting the OSS community and Ethereum users, but more through its security-related efforts than through its code contributions. There are also two new, non-OSS projects - [ETH Daily](https://octant.app/project/3/0xEB40A065854bd90126A4E697aeA0976BA51b2eE7) and [RefiDAO](https://octant.app/project/3/0x7340F1a1e4e38F43d2FCC85cdb2b764de36B40c0) - joining the Epoch. Both are well-known fixtures in the Ethereum grantmaking community. ETH Daily provides a _daily_ podcast and newsletter to a community of 2000+ subscribers. RefiDAO is a podcast, eventmaker, and DAO of DAOs ("local nodes") working on regenerative finance and other real world use cases. Check them out!

## Returning OSS projects

We won't go into detail of every returning project, but here are some high level metrics for the 18 OSS projects in Epoch 3 that we also covered in Epoch 2.
